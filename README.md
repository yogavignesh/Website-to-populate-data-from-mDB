TASK 3: QUESTIONS
-----------

a. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why? 

    I found the no sql db insertion and retrieval easy.Also ruby supports mongodb well.Jquery animations were easy.

b. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why? 

    I found the implementation of 100 ajax calls to be tough.It also took some effort to learn the Ruby basics to find a way       to retrieve one record at a time from db.
    
c. If you were to use these technologies professionally ,what would be your biggest concern? 

    I would definitely use Ruby for developing web applications as makes things easy but generating the files for you.
    But it is a language that takes some time to understand.Also the biggest concern would be to find all the dependencies for     the applcation being developed as Ruby does not have complete support like other javascript laguages like Node.js.
